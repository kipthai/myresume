    <p4>A few words...</p4>
    <p>
    I am a freelance product designer, in the process of moving to France within 2 months (Husband is France nationality), and currently looking to join a well-established product team like Doctolib.
    With my knowledge and experiences, I can design responsive and intuitive interfaces, engaging interactions and visual designs, perform users meetings & interviews, do new screens/flows according to requirements, help with small graphic design/animation design tasks, find UX/UI problems in current design and propose solutions, and further tasks if required. I am especially interested in our in-house design system Oxygen and believe that I can contribute to further perfect it.
    I have been holding important roles during the past 5 years in international, multi-cultured environments. I can work well independently and in a team setup. I believe that any skill, any tool can be learned, and I would never let them become a blocking stone on my way to achieving my goals.
    Here are a few bonus points that I can be a great fit for Doctolib team:
    I speak fluent English and native Vietnamese, which will help a lot in daily working activities and product accessibilities
    I graduated and have rich experience working in the international environment, which is perfect for our team considering we have team members from all over the world
    I have great experience in customer service, marketing which always can be useful when trying to balance between great user experience and business-related factors, pitching ideas to stakeholders/product manager.
    I am eager to learn and plan to use my gaining knowledge for a long-term commitment to the company
